## Overview

Research Project: Building a predictor model for political trust. The project follows the following pipline:

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   Raw data is processed and structured in `data/dataset_helper.py`. Dictionaries and cleaned datasets are managed here.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**  
   Initial exploration and visualizations are in `visualization/visualize_data.py`.

3. **Baseline Modeling**  
   A baseline Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is implemented in `models/baseline_ols.py`.Functions for OLS assumptions testing are found in:
   - `models/test_ols_assumptions.py`

4. **Feature Selection & Regularization**  
   Feature selection using BIC-guided L2 regularized bootstrapping and a basic feature selector is implemented in:
   - `models/bic_l2_bootstrap.py`
   - `models/feature_selector.py`

5. **Diagnostics**  
   Statistical assumption tests and multicollinearity checks:
   - `models/test_ols_assumptions.py`
   - `models/multicollinearity.py`

6. **Advanced Modeling**  
   Black-box models (Random Forest) are implemented in:
   - `models/random_forest.py`
  Output plots are saved to the `graphs/` folder

7. **Testing Suite**  
   Automated tests for code integrity are in `tests/test_suite.py`.

##Installing dependencies 
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running scripts from the project root 
Important: Do not run scripts by clicking the file or using the path directly. Always use the -m module flag or the provided runner.

Examples:

python -m models.baseline_ols

python -m models.bic_l2_bootstrap

python -m visualization.visualize_data

##TESTING 
Run automated tests to ensure everything is functioning as expected:

pytest tests/test_suite.py

##NOTES
All scripts assume execution from the project root.

Plots generated in the black_box_random_forest file are saved in the graphs/ folder.
